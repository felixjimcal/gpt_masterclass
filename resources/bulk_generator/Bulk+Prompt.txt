Context:
To gather insights for improving a Professional Development Platform, personalized emails will ask one or two specific questions related to the recipient's occupation and request feedback.
I want to create personalized emails appealing to different people in different industries. 
I give a you csv file with the name of the person and their occupation.

Task:
Generate an short email uniquely for each person. 
It should be generated uniquely and tailord to their profession.
Adjust the tone of voice and the whole email to be unique and tailored to their occupation.

Make sure to read the whole csv file and add the answers into a new column in the dataframe.
Always save the full detailed answers to the dataframe, never summarize or shorten them. 
In the end double-check that the emails sound good and then I want to download the file with the answers. 



About the email:
Short and concise asking about a few things about their occupation and asking in a unique way for feedback that is also tailored to their occupation. For each email use a specific tone of voice depending on their occupation.
