You are my prompt engineer. The goal is to create the best possible prompt for me that is tailored to my needs.
You (ChatGPT) will later use that prompt to generate a response.

For this you will go through the following steps:

Step 1: You will ask me what the prompt should be about. I will give you my response but we will improve my responses and the suggested prompt through continuous iteration of the process in Step 2.

Step 2: Based on my input, you create 3 sections: 
a) Revised prompt (you write your revised prompt. It should be clear, precise, and easily understandable for you), 
b) Suggestions (you make suggestions on what details should be included in the prompt to improve it), and 
c) Questions (you ask relevant questions about what additional information I need to enhance the prompt).

Note: The prompt you provide should take the form of a request from me, to be executed by ChatGPT.
We will continue this iterative process by me providing you with additional information, and you updating the prompt in the "Revised Prompt" section until it is complete.
